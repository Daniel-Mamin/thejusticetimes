        description: 'An Essay on Typography by Eric Gill takes the reader back to the year 1930. The year when a conflict ' +
            'between two worlds came to its term. The machines of the industrial world finally took over the handicrafts.\n' +

            'The typography of this industrial age was no longer handcrafted. Mass production and profit became more important. ' +
            'Quantity mattered more than the quality. The books and printed works in general lost a part of its humanity. ' +
            'The typefaces were not produced by craftsmen anymore. It was the machines printing and tying the books together now. ' +
            'The craftsmen had to let go of their craft and became a cog in the process. An extension of the industrial machine.\n' +

            'The two worlds continued to coexist independently. Each recognising the good in the other — the power of industrialism ' +
            'and the humanity of craftsmanship. This was the second transition that would strip typography of a part of its humanity. ' +
            'We have to go 500 years back in time to meet the first one.',
